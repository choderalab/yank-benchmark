# Input files for T4 lysozyme L99A and L99A/M102Q ligands binding free energies

The files were generated by the script `../../scripts/prepare_input_files.py`. Check the script documentation for an
up-to-date description of the procedure.


## Manifest

Ligands are grouped in different files based on the experimental buffer that was used to measure their binding affinity.

- `l99a-XYY.mcce.pdb`: T4 Lysozyme L99A in the `181L.pdb` configuration with protonation state assigned by MCCE at pH
`X.YY`.
- `ligands-l99a-X-Y.mol2`: ligands generated from SMILES string with OpenEye AM1-BCC charges that binds T4 L99A. All
the ligands whose identifier in `../t4ligands.json` is in between `ligand-l99a-X` and `ligand-l99a-Y` are included in
the file.
- `l99a-m102q-XYY.mcce.pdb`: T4 Lysozyme L99A/M102Q in the `1LI2.pdb` configuration with protonation state assigned by
MCCE at pH `X.YY`.
- `ligands-l99a-m102q-X-Y.mol2`: ligands generated from SMILES string with OpenEye AM1-BCC charges that binds T4
L99A/M102Q. All the ligands whose identifier in `../t4ligands.json` is in between `ligand-l99a-m102q-X` and
`ligand-l99a-m102q-Y` are included in the file.
