# Cyclodextrin

Host-guest set composed by alpha and beta cyclodextrin and 43 ligands (22 for alpha-CD and 21 for beta-CD). The
ITC experimental measurements can be found in [1]. Attach-pull-release (APR) calculations for the whole set are
described in [2]. The input files here were originally created for the latter work, and they were uploaded to
`[benchmarksets](https://github.com/MobleyLab/benchmarksets/)`.


## Manifest

- `input/`: the mol2 input files for the YANK pipeline.
- `cyclodextrin.yaml`: YANK script for setup and running the calculations.
